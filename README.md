## Feature Comparison

| Feature | AWS OpenSearch Serverless | AWS OpenSearch Managed | Milvus |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------------|--------|
| **Architecture** | Serverless, AWS-managed, autoscalable OCUs (OpenSearch Compute Units). No manual provisioning. | User-provisioned cluster; defined instances, storage, nodes, manually scaled. | Open-source vector database with distributed architecture. Can be self-hosted or used as a managed service (Zilliz Cloud). |
| **Pricing Model** | Consumption-based, pay-per-usage: per OCU-hour for indexing/search, storage billed separately (S3-backed, ~$0.024/GB-month). Minimum baseline required. | Instance-based pricing, billed per hour/node type. Storage (EBS) charged separately. Discounts available via Reserved Instances (up to ~52% savings). | Open-source (free) for self-hosting. Managed service (Zilliz Cloud) offers consumption-based pricing with scaling tiers. |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Ideal for unpredictable, spiky workloads (cost scales automatically). Higher baseline costs for minimal workloads (~$174-350/month). | More cost-efficient for steady workloads, especially with Reserved Instances. Lower entry costs (e.g., t3.small ~$26/month). | Free for self-hosting (infrastructure costs only). Managed service starts with a free tier, then pay-as-you-go based on usage. |
| **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** | Lower operational overhead, potentially higher monthly costs at scale. Ideal when operational simplicity matters. | Potentially lower monthly costs with predictable workloads. Operational complexity may increase hidden costs. | Lower software costs, potentially higher operational costs for self-hosted deployments. Managed service reduces operational overhead. |
| **Scalability** | Automatic, fine-grained scaling of compute and memory. Separates indexing/search components. Dynamically adjusts to traffic bursts. | Manual scaling required. Users must provision and adjust nodes manually for traffic spikes. | Horizontal scaling with distributed architecture. Manual scaling for self-hosted, automated for managed service. |
| **Performance (Query Latency & Throughput)** | Automatically scales shard replicas and OCUs during peaks. Maintains low latency (~milliseconds to sub-second) during spikes. Some latency in indexing propagation (seconds). | Sub-second latency achievable but dependent on manual scaling/provisioning. Performance degrades if not scaled proactively. | Optimized for vector similarity search with ANNS algorithms. Sub-millisecond query latency for million-scale vector datasets. |
| **Indexing Throughput** | High throughput, auto-scalable OCUs for indexing. Separate from search OCUs, ensuring predictable performance. | Shared indexing/search resources, requiring careful manual tuning to maintain consistent performance. | Supports batch processing and streaming data ingestion. Parallel indexing capabilities. |
| **Concurrent Queries** | Excellent support via dynamic scaling of OCUs; gracefully handles spikes in query concurrency. | Dependent on provisioned node capacity. Requires manual intervention to scale for concurrency increases. | Supports concurrent queries with load balancing. Performance depends on infrastructure provisioning. |
| **Operational Complexity** | Minimal: automatic upgrades, patches, backups, HA, scaling. Very limited operational management needed. | Moderate-high: Requires active management, cluster tuning, node sizing, backups, version upgrades, HA configuration. | Moderate complexity for self-hosted (requires Kubernetes). Low complexity for managed service. |
| **High Availability** | Built-in multi-AZ redundancy by default (minimum two replicas across AZs). Automatic fault tolerance. | Optional multi-AZ configuration. Requires manual provisioning and configuration of nodes/replicas for HA. | Supports high availability configurations with multi-replica deployments. Managed service includes HA by default. |
| **Feature Richness** | Core OpenSearch API support. No custom plugin uploads; limited set of pre-installed plugins. | Full OpenSearch API support; broader plugin selection. Supports selected custom plugins and files (e.g., dictionaries). | Specialized for vector search with multiple index types (HNSW, IVF, etc.). Python, Go, Java, and Node.js clients. |
| **Fine-Grained Access Control (Security)** | IAM-based data access policies (simplified, yet sufficiently granular for most use cases). | IAM and built-in FGAC (Fine-Grained Access Control) supporting field-level and document-level permissions. | Role-based access control. Authentication and authorization mechanisms available. |
| **Custom Document IDs** | Supported for search/vector collections; not supported for time-series. | Fully supported across all indexes. | Fully supports custom IDs for vectors and entities. |
| **Upsert & Update Operations** | Fully supported in search/vector collections; not supported for time-series collections. | Fully supported across all indexes. | Supports upsert and update operations across all collections. |
| **Cross-Cluster Operations** | No support (each collection isolated). | Supports cross-cluster search and cross-cluster replication. | Limited cross-cluster capabilities compared to OpenSearch. |
| **Storage Management** | Automatic S3-based storage (lower cost per GB). | Manually managed SSD (EBS) and optionally UltraWarm/cold storage tiers (costly at scale). | Supports local and cloud storage options. Separation of metadata and vector data. |
| **Data Durability & Backup** | Automatic via built-in S3-based architecture. Minimal user management. | Automatic daily snapshots (manual management available); EBS-backed storage. | Backup and restore capabilities. Snapshots for data persistence. |
| **Vector & Semantic Search** | Dedicated "vector search collections" optimized automatically (simplified setup). | Uses kNN plugin (manual setup & node sizing required). | Purpose-built for vector search with multiple ANN algorithms. Native support for embeddings and similarity search. |
| **Full-Text Search** | Robust full-text search capabilities | Comprehensive full-text search with advanced features | Limited or no native full-text search capabilities |

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Updating a Document by ID in OpenSearch Serverless (REST API)

```
POST /vector-index/_update/123 
Content-Type: application/json 
{ 
  "doc": { 
    "description": "Updated description for the document." 
  } 
}
```

**Explanation**
* **Endpoint**: `/vector-index/_update/123`
   * Replace `vector-index` with your index name.
   * Replace `123` with the ID of the document you want to update.
* **Request Body**:
   * The `doc` object contains the fields you want to update. In this case, it's updating the `description` field.

### Example 2: Working with AWS OpenSearch in Python

#### Installation

# AWS credentials and region
region = 'us-east-1'
service = 'aoss'  # 'es' for OpenSearch Managed, 'aoss' for OpenSearch Serverless
credentials = boto3.Session().get_credentials()
awsauth = AWS4Auth(
    credentials.access_key,
    credentials.secret_key,
    region,
    service,
    session_token=credentials.token
)

# For OpenSearch Serverless
host = 'your-collection-endpoint.us-east-1.aoss.amazonaws.com'  # Replace with your endpoint

# For OpenSearch Managed

import numpy as np

def index_document_with_vector(client, index_name, document_id, document_text, vector_field="embedding"):
    """
    Index a document with vector embedding in OpenSearch
    """
    # In a real application, you would use a proper embedding model
    # This is just a simplified example using random vector
    embedding_dimension = 384  # Example dimension for embeddings
    embedding = list(np.random.rand(embedding_dimension))  # Random vector
    
    document = {
        "text": document_text,
        vector_field: embedding
    }
    
    response = client.index(
        index=index_name,
        body=document,
        id=document_id,
        refresh=True  # Make document immediately searchable
    )
    
    return response

    """
    query = {
        "size": size,
        "query": {
            "knn": {
                vector_field: {
                    "vector": query_vector,
                    "k": size
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    response = client.search(
        body=query,
        index=index_name
    )
    
    return response

# Example usage
# In a real app, this would be your query embedding from the same model used for indexing
query_vector = list(np.random.rand(384))  # Random example vector

response = vector_search(client, "product-catalog", query_vector, size=3)
print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))

# Processing results
hits = response["hits"]["hits"]
for hit in hits:
    score = hit["_score"]
    source = hit["_source"]
    print(f"Score: {score}, Document: {source['text']}")
```

#### Example 6: Hybrid Search (Text + Vector)

```python
def hybrid_search(client, index_name, text_query, query_vector, vector_field="embedding", size=5):
    """
    Perform hybrid search combining text and vector similarity in OpenSearch
    """
    query = {
        "size": size,
        "query": {
            "script_score": {
                "query": {
                    "match": {
                        "text": text_query
                    }
                },
                "script": {
                    "source": "cosineSimilarity(params.vector, doc['" + vector_field + "']) + 1.0",
                    "params": {
                        "vector": query_vector
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    response = client.search(
        body=query,
        index=index_name
    )
    
    return response

# Example usage
text_query = "wireless headphones"
query_vector = list(np.random.rand(384))  # Random example vector

response = hybrid_search(client, "product-catalog", text_query, query_vector)
```

**Notes**
1. **Document ID**: For vector search collections, OpenSearch Serverless generates IDs automatically unless you explicitly store and manage them separately (e.g., in DynamoDB) when indexing documents.
2. **Limitations**: Upserts (insert if not exists, otherwise update) are not supported for vector search collections. You must ensure the document exists before attempting an update.
3. **Vector Dimensions**: The dimension of your vectors should be consistent with your OpenSearch configuration and the embedding model you're using.
4. **Authentication**: When working with AWS OpenSearch, always ensure proper IAM permissions are set up.
